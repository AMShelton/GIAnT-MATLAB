## Install

### MATLAB

Tested from **MATLAB R2023b** onward.

**Required toolboxes**
* Parallel Computing Toolbox
* Image Processing Toolbox
* Optimization Toolbox
* Signal Processing Toolbox
* Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

Clone this repository and add it (and its subfolders) to the MATLAB path:

```matlab
addpath(genpath('/path/to/GIAnT-MATLAB'));
```

Also add any external packages below to the path (e.g. `addpath(genpath(...))`).

### External packages

* **[Fast_Tiff_Write](https://github.com/rharkes/Fast_Tiff_Write)** — required for motion-correction TIFF writing (`Fast_BigTiff_Write`). Use commit [`ddd50c3286ff5b013d1f0478e8a5bd0d60978a75`](https://github.com/rharkes/Fast_Tiff_Write/commit/ddd50c3286ff5b013d1f0478e8a5bd0d60978a75). Do **not** use a later revision without checking TIFF orientation compatibility (upstream changed orientation after this commit).

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/rharkes/Fast_Tiff_Write.git
  cd Fast_Tiff_Write
  git checkout ddd50c3286ff5b013d1f0478e8a5bd0d60978a75
  ```

* **[NoRMCorre](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/NoRMCorre)** — required for the default (`StripRegistration`) motion-correction path.

* **SLAP2 data reader (only needed for SLAP2 data)** — add one of:
  - **[Slap2DataReader](https://github.com/m-xie/Slap2DataReader)**
  - **`slap2` from MBF Bioscience**

## How to run (default / non-SLAP2)

Typical flow for standard multi-TIFF / ScanImage-style recordings:

1. **`buildTrialTable`** — choose a data folder (and optional save folder). Writes `trial_table.h5` under the save directory.
2. **`StripRegistration`** — select that `trial_table.h5` (or pass its path). Writes registered TIFFs and `*_ALIGNMENTDATA.h5` under `motion_correction/`. Requires NoRMCorre and Fast_Tiff_Write on the path.
3. **Optional: `annotateROIs`** — draw exclude / soma ROIs; writes `annotations.h5`.
4. **`SILo`** — select the same `trial_table.h5` (or its folder). In the parameter GUI, leave **`isSLAP2`** as `false` (default). Writes `experiment_summary.h5` and `per_trial_summary.h5` under `source_extraction/`.

Example (interactive prompts omitted when paths are passed):

```matlab
buildTrialTable;                          % or buildTrialTable(datadr, savedr)
StripRegistration;                        % or StripRegistration(pathToTrialTable)
% annotateROIs;                           % optional
SILo;                                     % or SILo(pathToTrialTable)  % isSLAP2 = false
```

## How to run (SLAP2)

1. **`buildTrialTableSLAP2`** — builds `trial_table.h5` (including `slap2_info`) for SLAP2 `.dat` / metadata layouts.
2. **Motion correction** — choose one:
   - **`MultiRoiRegistration`** — multi-ROI raster SLAP2
   - **`BandRegistration`** — band-scan SLAP2  
   Requires a SLAP2 reader and Fast_Tiff_Write on the path (NoRMCorre is not used on these paths).
3. **Optional: `annotateROIs`**
4. **`SILo`** — in the parameter GUI, set **`isSLAP2`** to `true`.

```matlab
buildTrialTableSLAP2;
MultiRoiRegistration;   % or BandRegistration
% annotateROIs;
SILo;                   % isSLAP2 = true
```

### Runtime and resource optimizations

The SLAP2 processing path includes several optimizations for large multi-ROI recordings:

* **`MultiRoiRegistration`** streams the large `/slap2/varFacDS` variance-factor movie directly to H5 in small batches instead of holding the full 3-D array in each parallel worker. Registration also searches only within `clipShift` of the previous motion estimate, preventing correlation cost from growing with accumulated XY drift.
* **`SILo`** reads alignment metadata without loading `/slap2/varFacDS` into memory and performs activity localization in bounded spatial tiles. Variance data are read lazily from H5; when needed, they are temporarily rechunked for efficient spatial access.
* **Parallel worker counts are RAM-aware.** SILo estimates a safe worker count from available memory and registered-movie size rather than assuming that every requested worker can run concurrently.
* `localizationTileSize` (default `96` pixels) controls the SILo localization RAM/speed tradeoff. `localizationTempDir` controls where temporary rechunked H5 data are stored; a fast local SSD is recommended for best performance.

These changes substantially reduce peak RAM use, especially when processing several trials in parallel, while retaining the existing output-file schema. The main tradeoff is increased temporary disk I/O during SILo localization. For motion-heavy recordings, choose `clipShift` large enough to accommodate true frame-to-frame motion and QC the resulting motion traces.

## Epoch and analysis trial

For each experiment we break the data into **epochs** and **analysis trials**.

Epochs are full experimental sessions that can be aligned with each other (same field of view / ROIs). Analysis trials are contiguous subsets (in time) of an epoch; they may not match experimental trial boundaries exactly.

**SLAP2:** analysis trials are the experimental trials when multi-trial acquisition wrote one file per trial. For continuous SLAP2 acquisition, the experiment is split into analysis trials of length 200000 lines (~20 s) to help parallelize processing.

**Non-SLAP2:** the pipeline sets epoch = 1 and treats each selected file as an analysis trial. Those trials must be alignable to one another.

## Pipeline outputs

### Reading H5 outside MATLAB

GIAnT writes H5 from MATLAB. **Dimension tuples in this README match MATLAB `size()`** for each dataset (column-major in memory).

`h5py` and other non-MATLAB readers may assume a row-major order for the data. When reading data using Python or other languages, data axes may need to be permuted to match the axis orders listed here.

### Trial Table
Each experiment processed with GIAnT first gets a trial_table.h5 file that summarizes relevant file locations and analysis trial structures. The `slap2_info` group is only populated for SLAP2 experiments. The `motion_correction` and `source_extraction` groups are populated by downstream pipeline stages and will only be present once those stages have run. The structure of the trial_table is as below (🗄️ file · 📁 group · 🔤 string · 🔢 integer · 📈 numeric · 🖼️ image · ☑️ bool):

```
🗄️ trial_table.h5

### Alignment Data
The motion correction scripts save out a H5 file ending in `_ALIGNMENTDATA.h5` that contains the alignment data for each trial. The structure of the alignment data is as below

```
🗄️ <trial_stem>_ALIGNMENTDATA.h5
 ├ ☑️ row_major
 ├ 📈 numChannels
 ├ 📈 frametime
 ├ 📈 alignHz

### Manual Annotations

In our pipeline, users can manually annotate pixels to exclude from analysis or pixels that correspond to soma, whose signals should be extracted (e.g. single-neuron simultaneous glutamate + calcium imaging). When ROIs are annotated (either in `annotateROIs.m` or `SILo.m`), information about the ROIs are saved in the `annotations.h5` file. The structure of that file is as below

```
🗄️ annotations.h5
 ├ ☑️ row_major
 ├ ☑️ coords_zero_indexed
 └ 📁 Path{1,2}
    ├ 🔤 dr
    ├ 🔤 fn
    ├ 🔢 n_rois
    └ 📁 roi_###
       ├ 🔤 type
       ├ 🔤 label
       ├ 🖼️ mask
       ├ 📈 position (polygon only; nVertices x 2 [y_loc, x_loc] when flagged)
       ├ 📈 center (circle/ellipse; 1 x 2 [y_loc, x_loc] when flagged)
       ├ 📈 semi_axes (ellipse)
       ├ 📈 rotation_angle (ellipse)
       └ 📈 radius (circle)
```

### Experiment Summary

The final step of the pipeline, source extraction (Source Identification by Activity Localization; SILo), outputs an `experiment_summary.h5` file which contains the extracted sources as well as other useful data about the experiment. The structure of that file is as follows

```
🗄️ experiment_summary.h5

XY search limits (`xPre`, `yPre`, etc.) are shared across paths; per-path superpixel and reference-stack data live under `Path{n}` (one group per DMD, in trial-table path order). `Y`, `X`, and `Z` are the row, column, and reference-stack Z dimensions of the motion search cube (`yPre + yPost + 1`, etc.).

| Field | Size | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `row_major` | 1 x 1 | uint8 | Layout flag: `1` = row-major (README sizes match h5py `shape`); `0` = column-major (MATLAB `size()`). **If absent, assume column-major (`0`).** |

| `Path{n}/zPost` | 1 x 1 | numeric | Maximum reference-stack Z shift searched **after** the matched plane (planes); capped similarly to `zPre` |
| `Path{n}/fastZ2RefZ` | numFastZs x 1 | numeric | Maps each imaged fast-Z index to the nearest reference-stack Z plane index (used when sampling `likelihood_means`) |

### `annotations.h5`

`annotations.h5` is written by `annotateROIs.m` and by `SILo.m` (when `drawUserRois=true`).  
String fields are stored as UTF-16 code units (`uint16`) for robust MATLAB/Python compatibility.

**Indexing conventions.** New files set `/coords_zero_indexed` to `1` and store `position`/`center` as **0-indexed `[y_loc, x_loc]`** (row, column), matching image axis order. Legacy files without this flag use MATLAB `images.roi` convention: **1-indexed `[x, y]`** (column, row).

| Field | Size | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `row_major` | 1 x 1 | uint8 | Layout flag: `1` = row-major (README sizes match h5py `shape`); `0` = column-major (MATLAB `size()`). **If absent, assume column-major (`0`).** |
| `coords_zero_indexed` | 1 x 1 | uint8 | When `1`, `position`/`center` are 0-indexed `[y_loc, x_loc]`; when absent or `0`, legacy 1-indexed `[x, y]` |
| `Path{n}` | — | group | One group per imaging path in trial-table order |
| `Path{n}/dr` | 1 x nChars | uint16 | Motion-correction directory used while drawing these ROIs |
| `Path{n}/fn` | 1 x nChars | uint16 | Trial stem used when displaying ROI GUI |
| `Path{n}/n_rois` | 1 x 1 | uint32 | Number of saved ROI entries for this path |
| `Path{n}/roi_###/type` | 1 x nChars | uint16 | ROI geometry type: `polygon`, `circle`, or `ellipse` |
| `Path{n}/roi_###/label` | 1 x nChars | uint16 | User label (e.g., `SOMA`) |

| `Path{n}/roi_###/center` | 1 x 2 | double | Circle/ellipse center `[y_loc, x_loc]` when `coords_zero_indexed=1`, else legacy `[x, y]` |
| `Path{n}/roi_###/semi_axes` | 1 x 2 | double | Ellipse semi-axes lengths (ellipse only) |
| `Path{n}/roi_###/rotation_angle` | 1 x 1 | double | Ellipse rotation angle in degrees (ellipse only) |

### `experiment_summary.h5`

`SILo.m` writes `experiment_summary.h5` in `source_extraction/`. Dimensions use one `total frames` axis for all trials from that path stitched in time.

**Indexing conventions.** Pixel/plane coordinates in `sources/spatial/coords` and related peak/coordinate fields are written in **0-indexed (HDF5/Python)** convention as `[z_loc, y_loc, x_loc]`, matching image axis order (`fastz`, rows, cols). `z_loc` is the 0-based index into the `fastz` axis of `profiles`; `y_loc`/`x_loc` are row/column centroids in `[0, dim-1]`. A few fields are kept **1-indexed** to retain SLAP2 data conventions.

| Field | Size | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `row_major` | 1 x 1 | uint8 | Layout flag: `1` = row-major (README sizes match h5py `shape`); `0` = column-major (MATLAB `size()`). **If absent, assume column-major (`0`).** |
| `params` | — | struct | Analysis parameters (`SILo` `params` struct). `params/activityChannel` is **1-indexed** into the recording's `numChannels` channels — use it to pick the glutamate channel from any `channels x …` dataset in this file (e.g., `global/F`, `sources/temporal/dF_ls`) |

### `per_trial_summary.h5`

`SILo.m` writes `per_trial_summary.h5` alongside `experiment_summary.h5` in `source_extraction/`. The trial axis matches `trial_table.h5` (all analysis trials); trials without alignment or source-extraction data are left as NaN in the corresponding slices.

**Indexing conventions.** Same as `experiment_summary.h5`: coordinate fields use **0-indexed** `[z_loc, y_loc, x_loc]` (image axis order: `fastz`, rows, cols); `z_loc` is the 0-based `fastz` index, currently always `0`.

| Field | Size | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `row_major` | 1 x 1 | uint8 | Layout flag: `1` = row-major (README sizes match h5py `shape`); `0` = column-major (MATLAB `size()`). **If absent, assume column-major (`0`).** |
